# About 
This is a demo website of the Online Job Portal where a person can register as a job provider or a job seeker. This site shows how an online website actually works & uses its databases to collect registered information; also gives an idea about how they help us to find perfect candidates for jobs. In this demo, the website can be run by `Apache` localhost.
# Requirements
- Xampp<br />
-	MySQL Workbench<br />
-	Sublime text
# Installation
1. Put the `Online Job-Portal` folder into this location:`"C:\xampp\htdocs"`.
2. Run Xampp, then click on `start`; from both of the modules `Apache` & `MySQL`. Next, click on `admin` from that `MySQL`; this will open the admin panel of the database named `phpMyAdmin`.
3. Import the `online_job_portal.sql` database on that website.
4. To use the data entry using the website:
- Put this address on a browser:<br />
`http://localhost/Online%20Job-Portal/Homepage/homepage.php`
- This will open the Homepage of the site & data can be entered on the indicated places of that webpage.
- The entered data will show on the `online_job_portal` database of that MySQL admin website.
# Disclaimer
Some pages can not be loaded as they have been not added to this demo, also some unnecessary pages have been removed. Some tables on the database may not be able to get data from the website because they have not been linked through SQL with the database.
